Protocol for maintaining a long TCP link

1. If first connected, set link status as connected.
2. Keep link status as connected until a read/write error occurs.
3. When connected, send pulse packet (1 byte) per second:
    if send failed, set link status as disconnected
4. If disconnected, reconnect immediately every 1 second
