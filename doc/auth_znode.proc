Protocol for Znode auth

1. If znode is a relaying node, auth immediately
2. If znode is a end node, GW send auth request with node id, gw id, and cache to server, and wait maximum 16 s
3. If server send back auth ACK, GW set dev as auth
4. If no-responding or server send back auth-no ACK, GW set dev as auth-no
